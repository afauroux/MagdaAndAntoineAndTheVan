Badlands NP is located one hour drive from the Black Hills. The name of this place was given by French trappers, who upon reaching this area, decided it was a really bad land to travel - "mauvais terres". The badlands are a series of bluffs between two grassy plateaus, where bisons graze.

We followed the road that serpents along the cliffs. The weather was great, and the park is very camper-friendly - it offers a free campsite within its borders and several approved wild camping spots just outside.
